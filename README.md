## Portf Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase various small projects as part of my portfolio. Below you'll find a brief overview of the projects currently available in this repository:

### Projects:

1. **Linear Regression on Python**
   - **Description:** This project involves implementing linear regression in Python. It includes a Jupyter notebook (`Linear_regression_BMI_to_Glucose.ipynb`) where I have performed linear regression analysis on data related to BMI and glucose levels.
   - **Files:**
     - `Linear_regression_BMI_to_Glucose.ipynb`
     - `diabetes.csv`

2. **SQL Test Task February**
   - **Description:** This project contains files related to a SQL test task conducted in February. It includes a SQL file (`SQL_test_task.sql`) which presumably contains SQL queries or scripts for the task.
   - **Files:**
     - `SQL_test_task.sql`

3. **CV2 Pet1**
   - **Description:** This project includes a Python script (`cv2_pet1.py`) related to computer vision tasks, specifically dealing with cars on highways.

5. **LLM GPT Post Generation service: ML with Hugging Face**
- **Description:** This machine learning project demonstrates fine-tuning a GPT-2 model from Hugging Face for Ukrainian language post generation. It showcases the use of transfer learning in NLP, utilizing the Transformers library. The project includes a Python script for model training and a Gradio interface for interactive post generation.

- **Files:**
   - 'ml_post_generation_service.py' (main ML script)
   - 'gradio_interface.py (user interface)'
   - 'dataset70train.csv (training data)'
   - 'dataset30test.csv (test data)'
